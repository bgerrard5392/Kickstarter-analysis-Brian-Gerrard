# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
For this project I analyzed Kickstarter data to educate Louise on crowdfunding by pulling insights, trends, and highlighting the factors that go into launching a successful crowdfunding campaign. Louise is launching her first campaign on Kickstarter for her play “Fever” and has a budget of $12,000.
### Purpose
This analysis was performed on several thousand crowdfunding projects with the goal of uncovering insights that will help Louise launch and run a successful campaign for her play.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Theater campaigns launched in the middle of the year (May, June, and July timeframe) are more successful than campaigns launched throughout the rest of the year. 

Though there are more campaigns launched during those months, the success rate of that 3 month timeframe (successful campaigns/total campaigns) is only a few points higher than the average success rate per month. For example: 166 campaigns were launched in May and 111 of those were successful. If you look just at successes May has the most by a large amount, but if you look at the success rate (successful campaigns/total campaigns) for May, that is 67% which is only 6% higher than the yearly average.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Kickstarter provided insight into outcomes relating to play campaigns. Since Louise’s goal was $12,000 she fell into the $10,000-$14,999 goal range.

There were 72 total plays in the $10,000-$14,000 goal range, 39 of the 72 were successful which means there is a roughly a 54% chance of successfully hitting her goal of $12,000.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Kickstarters launched during the middle months (May, June, July) are more successful than those launched any other time in the year.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
This data set included several Kickstarter projects whose campaigns were still live during my analysis. Since I am unable to determine if a live campaign is a success or failure this poses a limitation within the dataset. 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
